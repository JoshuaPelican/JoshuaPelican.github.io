            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Krafts is an arts and crafts making experience made for a 48 hour game jam run by Game Makers Tool Kit
                (GMTK). With the theme of "Joined Together" I was inspired by glue and wanted to make a therapeutic
                experience reminiscent of kindergarten arts and crafts. <br> <br>

                Players can arrange many different objects, glue
                them together, and even draw on them! After they finish they can shake off any un-glued objects and save
                a screenshot of their creation to their device. During the jam I engaged with the community by
                collecting their screenshots and putting them on the main game page!
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">
            <h2>Sprite Layering</h2>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>
                <br>
                A huge issue I ran into right away was making sure the sprites were being layered as someone would
                expect them to be. If a player grabs an object it should be on top of everthing else, and any new
                objects would be on top of that. My quick and dirty solution for the game jam was to use the Z-axis to
                layer the sprites.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
public class ToolManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float currentZ = 0;
    
    public void NextZ()
    {
        currentZ -= .01f;
    }
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                In a manager script, I kept track of a global Z value, and decremented it (brought it closer to the
                camera) every time I needed to move an object to the front. This value then keeps track of the Z value
                to make the next highest object.
            </p>
            <video autoplay muted loop class="gameplay-video" src="../videos/snippets/krafts-layering.mp4"></video>
            <pre>
                <code>
{
    if (ToolManager.instance.SelectedTool == ToolManager.Tool.Manipulate)
    {
        ToolManager.instance.NextZ();
        SetActive(true);
    }
}
    
if (active)
{
    transform.position = new Vector3(InputUtility.MousePosition.x, InputUtility.MousePosition.y, ToolManager.instance.currentZ);
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                When I grab an object, I can now set the object's Z coordinate to be this value, and bring it to the
                front immediately.
                <br> <br>
                If I was to redo this system, given more time, I would like to keep a similar Z coordinate system, but
                clean it up. There were alot of issues related to local vs world space coordinates. Sometimes grabbing
                an object would not bring it to the front because previously glued objects had stacked Z values and
                surpassed the current global Z value.
